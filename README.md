Securities finance derivatives - Research and specific features

I – Introduction

At first glance, Securities finance products, both synthetic (TRS) and physical (repo), are "simple" products. But their OTC characteristics and their strong links with other asset classes can lead to very specific features and calculation topics. the goal of this repository is highlighting, as most as possible, those special and interesting features

II – Models and features

Each folder will be focused on dedicated pricing model/features which can be interesting for Securities finance products but, if possible, interesting for quantitative finance frameworks in general

III – Numerical results

A pure mathematical work is useless without proper results and values. That wil be the second target : python + C++ code in order to highlight results
