Securities finance derivatives (total return swaps) - quantitative overview

I – Introduction

Total return swaps (TRS), depsite their "delta one" characteristic, are derivatives among others, and then can be analyzed/priced with legacy mechanisms used for other derivatives. This repository aims to target two mathematical modelization and numerical goals which will be detailed later

II – Models

TRS are OTC swaps which embedd both "worlds", rate and equity. Pricing models used for Convertible Bond (for example pricing equation and finite difference) can then be also used in order to model those products. That will be the first target : a specific pricing documentation about TRS, from simple case to exotics (as OTC, TRS can be very "special")

III – Numerical results

A pure mathematical work is useless without proper results and values. That wil be the second target : python + C++ code in order to highlight model implementations, including both PDE and Monte-Carlo methods
